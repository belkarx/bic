# BIC
Play the game [Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) against a computer because no one else wants to play with you. Context: I made this while on a roadtrip. 

Just run `python3 client.py` and enjoy. 

Note: the gameplay is logged to `bic_log.txt` in the directory where the script is run so you can track your improvement/general playing.
